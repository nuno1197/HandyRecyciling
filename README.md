Recycling stands as one of the most effective contemporary practices for pollution prevention.
Through the process of recycling, a reduction in our reliance on finite natural resources is
achieved, concurrently leading to energy conservation, decreased carbon dioxide emissions,
and economic savings. In the context of the European Union, it is noteworthy that Portugal
currently registers one of the lowest recycling rates. Consequently, it becomes imperative
for the nation to commit towards accomplish the European objective of recycling all singleuse
packaging materials. A significant strategy to boost these recycling rates involves
the widespread deployment of small, medium or large capacity waste containers, typically
ranging from 120 liters to 360 liters, across municipalities. However, the efficient management
of these containers necessitates a consistent and meticulous approach by waste collection
entities. Presently, the methodology employed in this regard is antiquated, characterized
by waste collection teams manually inspecting each container within their designated areas
to check their fill status. This labor-intensive process poses inherent inefficiencies and
challenges. The primary objective of this masterâ€™s project involves the development of
a system capable of detecting and classifying urban waste containers. This goal holds
promising applications in the domain of waste management, potentially facilitating the
generation of daily collection routes in the future. Images for this study were sourced from
individual contributors, from Street View feature in Google Maps and a project known as
Tidy City, which gathers various items, including containers, from a designated municipality.
Subsequently, a model was constructed with the ability to discern and categorize a specific
container based on the type of waste it accommodates, the configuration of the container
(e.g., 4 wheels, 2 wheels), and the condition of its lid (open, closed, or full). Additionally,
the model demonstrates proficiency in identifying and classifying waste materials in close
proximity to the container.
