<p align="left">
  Recycling stands as one of the most effective contemporary practices for pollution prevention.
Through the process of recycling, a reduction in our reliance on finite natural resources is
achieved, concurrently leading to energy conservation, decreased carbon dioxide emissions,
and economic savings. In the context of the European Union, it is noteworthy that Portugal
currently registers one of the lowest recycling rates. Consequently, it becomes imperative for
the nation to commit towards accomplish the European objective of recycling all single-use
packaging materials.
A significant strategy to boost these recycling rates involves the widespread deployment
of small, medium or large capacity waste containers, typically ranging from 120 liters to
360 liters, across municipalities. However, the efficient management of these containers
necessitates a consistent and meticulous approach by waste collection entities.
Presently, the methodology employed in this regard is antiquated, characterized by waste
collection teams manually inspecting each container within their designated areas to check
their fill status. This labor-intensive process poses inherent inefficiencies and challenges.
The principal aim of this Masterâ€™s work resides in the development of a system capable of
detecting and classifying urban solid waste containers. This goal opens the door to potential
applications in the world of waste collection, generating, for example, daily collection routes
in the future.
